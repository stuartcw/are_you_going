## 1. Questions Relating to Tuesdays and Fridays

Almost ten years ago I was accepting random invitations to go out each week and it became too much. I joined a group of people who went out twice a week and so I direct people who want to meet to join me on a Tuesday or Friday at the regular places.

### Q1.1. Will you be going tonight?
**A.** I will be there on **Tuesdays** and **Fridays**, regardless of whether anyone else goes or not. *If I can’t make it on a Tuesday or a Friday, I will let you know.*

Exceptions:  
* 1.1.1 There is a government advisory due to natural disaster or pandemic in place.
* 1.1.2 There is a football match on that day when I will be at the stadium if it is a home match or at the HUB that is showing it. This overrides all other rules.
* 1.1.3 Inclement weather.  

### Q1.2. Are you interested in going somewhere else?
**A.** Probably not.

### Q1.3. Are you interested in going on another night?
**A.** If we change Tuesday back to Wednesday, I’ll try and be there. Otherwise, no.

### Q1.4. How about tonight?
**A.** See Q1. Is it Tuesday or Friday? No. Otherwise, I would end up going out every night.

### Q1.5. “But John is going tonight…”
**A.** Yes, maybe I'll go, if it is his last week.

### Q1.6. What time will you be there?
**A.** It takes about an hour to get there and I usually leave around 17:45. So, hopefully, I should be there before 19:00.

### Q1.7. What time will you leave?
**A.** 9PM.

## Questions Related Other Days

### Q1.8. Are you going out on Saturday Night?
**A.** No. The only exception being if it is a football night. See Football Match Related Questions.

## 2. Football Match Related Questions

### 2.1 Will you go to the Shin-Yokohama HUB after the match.
**A.** Yes. They kindly reserve a table for me so by default I will go there. If there is a change for any reason I will announce it.
