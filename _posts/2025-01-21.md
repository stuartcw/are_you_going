I won't be going tonight.

Iâ€™m feeling a bit tired today so I will stay home. I met my old AXA collegue at Haneda this morning as she is en-route to the US. Osaka->Haneda->California.  If it had been in the afternoon I might have been able to come. I will sleep early tonight. I probably need the rest more than a late night out. Hopefully see you Friday.
